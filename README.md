# Problem Statement
QVC provides its customers with a variety of product offerings around the globe. The largest market for QVC is currently the US.  In the US alone, QVC ships millions of packages each year to enrich its customers’ lives.  The future of fulfilling customer orders and meeting or exceeding their expectations is always at the forefront of QVC’s decisions.  One expectation is related to delivery speed.  Some retailers, primarily online retailers, focus primarily on quick turnaround on shipping goods to customers.  The faster the turnaround the more extensive the logistics/delivery network or the more costly it is.  QVC doesn’t just provide its customers with products, it prides itself on top notch customer service and a rich and rewarding overall experience.
Your challenge is to analyze QVC’s customer geography, distribution network, and product mix, purchase patterns and develop a visualization that contains useful information for QVC to use to understand what the relationship between speed of product/package delivery and customer loyalty is.
Your analysis should address one or more of the following questions:

•	Does the current distribution network maximize customer penetration (spend)?  If not, what should QVC do to increase customer penetration with the current distribution network?

•	Are there specific products or product categories that should be located in specific distribution centers?

•	Do customers that receive their product sooner purchase more than customers with longer delivery times?
